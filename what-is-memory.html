                                                                                                    <p>Your brain is an incredibly complex organ that stores all kinds of information. Some of it is simple and straightforward, like your name or the date you went on vacation. Other things are more complex, like the way to drive to work on a particular day or the way to get there without getting lost. These types of memories are called “declarative” because they are facts that you can state in words. Other types of memories are not so straightforward and are often referred to as “non-declarative” memories. These include skills like riding a bike or playing tennis, not to mention more basic things like walking and talking. Memory is the process by which you acquire new knowledge and skills and remember past experiences. It’s what allows you to recognize a face you’ve seen before or drive home from work without getting lost. Memory is made up of many different parts, including the ability to encode information, store it temporarily, and then retrieve it when needed. Memory isn’t like a computer where you can simply delete a file by hitting the delete key. Memory is more like a hard drive where you can overwrite data to make room for new information, but it doesn’t disappear completely. Here are some useful definitions of memory terms:</p><h2>What is long-term memory?</h2><p>Long-term memory is the part of your memory that holds information that you’ve acquired over a period of time. This includes things like your phone number, the name of your high school chemistry teacher, and where you parked your car this morning. This type of memory is also referred to as “explicit” or “declarative” memory. It’s the kind of memory that you can test by asking someone if they remember what you did on your last date or what the name of their childhood pet was.Short-term memory is the part of your memory that you use to store information for a few minutes. This includes things like your phone number or the name of your high school chemistry teacher. Short-term memory is also referred to as “implicit” or “non-declarative” memory. It’s the kind of memory that you can’t test with your friend because it doesn’t exist in a way that you can remember it.Short-term memory is most often used to help us focus on the present moment. When you’re reading a book, for example, your brain is using short-term memory to store the information from the pages you read so that you can easily recall it when you turn the page. When you’re driving to work, your brain is using short-term memory to store the directions you read on your way there so that you can easily recall them when you get to your destination.</p><h2>What is working memory?</h2><p>Working memory is the part of your memory that you use to complete a task or solve a problem. For example, if you are trying to remember a phone number you have to encode it so that it can be stored in your long-term memory. Once you’ve encoded the phone number, you also have to use working memory to keep the number in mind until you can write it down. Working memory is also referred to as “shallow” or “episodic” memory. This is because it’s used to store information that comes from your short-term memory and that you can use to complete a task.For example, if you are trying to remember the name of the person you just met, you first have to encode the information in your short-term memory. Once the information is in your long-term memory, you can then use working memory to keep the name in mind until you can write it down. Working memory is also used to solve problems. For example, if you are trying to remember how to get to the grocery store, you would first have to encode the information in your short-term memory. Once it’s in your long-term memory, you can then use working memory to keep the directions in mind until you can write them down.</p><h2>What is procedural memory?</h2><p>Procedural memory is the part of your memory that allows you to perform skills, like riding a bike or playing tennis. This type of memory is also referred to as “skill learning” or “habit learning” because it’s the part of your memory that allows you to acquire new skills.Procedural learning is not as straightforward as declarative learning. You can’t just read a book on how to ride a bike or watch a YouTube video on how to play tennis. Instead, you have to actually practice riding a bike or playing tennis. Your brain stores the information you’ve acquired through procedural learning in your long-term memory. When you need to perform the same skill again, you can then use your procedural memory to help you. For example, if you are trying to remember how to ride a bike, you would first have to encode the information in your short-term memory. Once it’s in your long-term memory, you can then use procedural memory to help you ride the bike again.</p><h2>What is emotional memory?</h2><p>Emotional memory is the part of your memory that allows you to associate an experience with a feeling, like happiness or sadness. For example, if you meet a friend at a wedding and they give you a present, you might remember the gift and the happiness it brought you.Emotional memories are often associated with positive feelings like happiness and joy. Negative emotions, like anger or sadness, are more associated with traumatic events like war or abuse. The reason for this is because negative emotions are more harmful to the body than positive emotions. Negative emotions like anger and sadness can actually cause problems for the person experiencing them. Negative emotions can also harm relationships and damage property. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are usually associated with happy memories. Emotional memories are often associated with positive feelings like happiness and joy because of the way your brain processes emotions. When you experience an emotion like happiness, your brain releases chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. These chemicals are associated with positive feelings and are often referred to as “happy chemicals.” When you experience a negative emotion, like anger, your brain releases chemicals called “stress hormones” like cortisol. These stress hormones are associated with negative feelings and can cause damage to your body and relationships.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Memory is the process by which you acquire new knowledge and skills and remember past experiences. It’s what allows you to recognize a face you’ve seen before or drive home from work without getting lost. Memory is made up of many different parts, including the ability to encode information, store it temporarily, and then retrieve it when needed. Memory isn’t like a computer where you can simply delete a file by hitting the delete key. Memory is more like a hard drive where you can overwrite data to make room for new information, but it doesn’t disappear completely. Memory is an important part of everyday life, but it’s important to understand the different types so that you can maintain healthy habits.</p>
